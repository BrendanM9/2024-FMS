Welcome to the 2024 First Lego League FMS!

This code is intended to run a Python Flask server that will meet all of your First Lego League Challenge competition needs. From your homepage, you can create a new event, or select an existing event. After that, you can schedule your matches. This website features the Audience Display feature, where a computer has the capability to be hooked up to a streaming service with live scoring. From the FTA Dashboard, event FTAs can open monitoring screens of the event, control the audience display, post scores, add event awards, and replay matches. All of this and more is available with the FLL FMS.

To download to your computer:
1. Download as a .zip file.
2. Open this folder. This is where all of your data will be.
3. Open the fmsRunner.py file, and run it. This will set up the Flask server.
4. Go to localhost:5000 or edit the final line of fmsRunner.py with an IP to host. This is where you can access the site.
5. You are set up. Follow instructions on the website to proceed.

The FTA credentials:
Username: root

Happy competing!
